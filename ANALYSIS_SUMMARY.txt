KLIX FRONTEND CODEBASE - ANALYSIS SUMMARY
Generated: November 6, 2025

1. ADMIN DASHBOARD STATUS: DELETED
- Admin pages were implemented in commit be9c2d2
- Admin pages were deleted in commit f51b5c0 (latest merge)
- Admin API endpoints still exist and functional
- Admin sidebar menu items reference deleted routes (404 errors)

2. ADMIN FEATURES THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED:
- Analytics Dashboard (757 lines)
- Organizer Approval Workflow
- Promoter Approval Workflow
- User Management
- Event Moderation
- Admin Settings
- Debug/API Testing Dashboard

3. CORE INFRASTRUCTURE - FULLY FUNCTIONAL:
✓ Authentication (Firebase + JWT)
✓ Authorization (Role-based access control)
✓ State Management (Zustand)
✓ API Client (Axios with token management)
✓ UI Components (shadcn/ui)
✓ Form Validation (React Hook Form + Zod)

4. USER DASHBOARDS - FULLY FUNCTIONAL:
✓ Attendee Dashboard (/dashboard)
✓ Organizer Dashboard (/organizer)
✓ Promoter Dashboard (/promoter)
✓ Event Staff Dashboard (/staff)

5. TECHNOLOGY STACK:
- Next.js 15.5.4 with React 19
- TypeScript 5
- Tailwind CSS 4
- shadcn/ui Components
- Zustand for state management
- Firebase Authentication
- Axios HTTP client

6. API ENDPOINTS - ADMIN:
All endpoints defined in src/lib/api-client.ts
- Statistics
- User Management (list, get, delete, update, suspend)
- Organizer Management (list, pending, approve, reject, suspend)
- Promoter Management (pending, approve, reject, suspend)
- Event Management (flag, unflag, force delete)
- Analytics (overview, summary, growth, revenue, etc)
- Audit Logs
- Cache Management

7. KEY FILES:
- src/lib/api-client.ts - Main API wrapper
- src/hooks/useAuth.ts - Zustand authentication store
- src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx - Role-based access
- src/components/dashboard/Sidebar.tsx - Navigation
- src/lib/types.ts - Type definitions

8. CRITICAL ISSUES:
Issue 1: Admin pages deleted but sidebar still references them
Impact: Clicking admin menu items results in 404 errors
Solution: Recreate admin pages or hide admin menu

Issue 2: No admin dashboard UI exists
Impact: Admins cannot perform admin operations via UI
Solution: Implement admin pages from git history or scratch

9. IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
READY:
✓ API endpoints
✓ Authentication
✓ Authorization framework
✓ Component library
✓ Type system

NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION:
✗ Admin page components
✗ Admin dashboard layout
✗ Admin views and screens
✗ Route definitions

10. RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Retrieve admin pages from git commit be9c2d2
2. Or create new admin pages from scratch using existing patterns
3. Fix sidebar navigation to point to valid routes
4. Test admin operations thoroughly
5. Implement admin action confirmation/warnings

ESTIMATED TIME TO FIX:
- From git history: 2-4 hours
- New implementation: 8-12 hours
- Testing: 4-6 hours
